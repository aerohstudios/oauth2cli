oauthcli
================

Generic OAuth 2.0 command-line utility to retrieve access tokens.

About
-----

`oauthcli` is a developer productivity tool. It's helpful when juggling across multiple tech stacks and you need an OAuth `access_token` to make an API call, but you don't have a quick way to generate the `access_token`. Moreover, `oauthcli` uses standard python library and doesn't have any external dependencies.

Installation, usage instructions, and examples are available on the `Github repo`_.
